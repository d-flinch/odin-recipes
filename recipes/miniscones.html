    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons white sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1Â½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/4 cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh blueberries </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons orange zest</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>    
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the air fryer to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Stir together flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking soda, 
                and salt in a medium bowl. Cut in butter with 2 knives or pastry blender 
                until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Beat egg with a fork in a small bowl. Remove 2 tablespoons egg to another 
                small bowl; set aside. Add buttermilk and vanilla extract to remaining egg; 
                whisk with the fork until combined. Stir into flour mixture until just moistened. 
                Gently stir in blueberries.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface. Gently knead until dough is no 
                longer sticky, about 8 to 10 strokes. Pat dough into a 6-inch circle. Cut into 8 
                wedges, without separating, dipping the knife in flour between cuts.</li>
            <li>Combine remaining 2 tablespoons sugar and orange zest in a small bowl. Brush top 
                of dough with reserved egg and sprinkle with sugar mixture. Separate dough wedges 
                and carefully arrange them, using a small wide spatula, in a single layer in the 
                fryer basket, in batches if necessary.</li>
            <li>Cook scones until golden brown, about 6 minutes. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
