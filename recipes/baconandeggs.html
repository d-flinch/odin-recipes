    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>It's the ring of bacon that makes these egg bites a visual standout on your brunch table. </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
            <li>12 slices of bacon</li>
            <li>10 eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped green onion</li>
            <li>1/4 cup diced jalapeno pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup diced roasted red pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Prepare 12 muffin cups with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Arrange bacon on a microwave-safe plate. Cook bacon in microwave for 75 seconds.</li>
            <li>Place a slice of bacon into each muffin cup so that the bacon lines the edges of the cup.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs and milk together in a bowl; ladle into muffin cups. Top 4 of the egg portions 
                with 1 tablespoon each of the green onion, 4 with 1 tablespoon each jalapeno pepper, and 
                4 each with 1 tablespoon roasted red pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until only slightly moist on top, about 20 minutes. Season the 
                muffins with salt and pepper; top with Cheddar cheese. Continue baking until the cheese 
                melts, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        </ol>
